  <!--
    Placeholder for custom CompProperties-driven defaults.
    The actual comp classes live in C#:

    - CompDevilFruitTracker (tracks which fruit types exist in the world)
        • fruitType (string): matches your ThingDef’s <fruitType> tag

    - CompTargetEffect_GomuAbility (applies the GomuGomu ability/trait)
        • no extra XML fields needed here

    You can come back here later if you want to expose XML-configurable
    fields for these components (e.g. durations, severities, etc.).
